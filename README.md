**Alignment Marker Fabrication Process**

**Overview**

This repository documents the development and standardization of a photolithography-based alignment marker fabrication process used for device registration and sample alignment in the Quantum Materials and Devices Lab at Duke University.

The project focuses on optimizing process steps to achieve high-fidelity Cr/Au alignment markers on SiOâ‚‚/Si substrates with micron-level precision. Through workflow redesign and parameter optimization, total fabrication time was reduced from 12 to 6 hours per 80 markers, while maintaining sub-2 Âµm feature resolution and consistent pattern reproducibility.

This process is now adopted as the labâ€™s standard protocol for marker-chip fabrication and serves as the foundation for subsequent device fabrication steps, including graphene and hBN stacking and superconducting device fabrication.

**Fabrication Summary**

Substrate: SiOâ‚‚/Si wafers (285 nm oxide layer)
Metallization: Cr/Au (5 nm / 50 nm) via thermal evaporation
Resolution: â‰¤ 2 Âµm
